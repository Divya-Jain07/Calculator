Basic Calculator
This is my first project using JavaScript, where I built a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
The interface is clean and user-friendly, making it easy to use.

Features::
1. Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, ×, ÷)
2. Square (x²), Square Root (√), and Reciprocal (1/x)
3. Percentage and sign change options
4. Clear and delete functionality
5. Option to type or click buttons for input (typing works for numbers and basic operations, but not for exponents)

Technologies Used::
1. HTML for structure
2. CSS for styling
3. JavaScript for functionality

How to Use::
1. Open the calculator in your browser.
2. Enter numbers using the keyboard or click on the buttons.
3. Choose an operation and press "=" to see the result.
4. Use "C" to clear and "←" to delete the last entry.
